  bio: |
    My name is Eric Stanley. Started my career as a QA tester back in 2005 and have been learning software testing ever since. For those who have no idea what WinRunner is, I worked on that! After recent technology evolution, I figured development will eventually replace testing, so I started learning a little development! I see a lot of content in the internet on ‘how to start a (successful) blog’, but no one says how to stay a blogger, which is why I didn’t learn that yet and this is my current attempt.
